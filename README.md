# Bottle Detection and Segmentation

This project focuses on employing machine learning models to identify (detection) and segment bottles within images. The process is divided into two main phases: Detection using the Faster R-CNN model, followed by Segmentation using the U-Net model. Additionally, there's a transition notebook that bridges the detection results to segmentation.

## Faster R-CNN for Detection

The `Faster_R_CNN_for_detection` directory is dedicated to the detection phase. Within this phase, images are processed to identify and locate bottles. The Faster R-CNN model is utilized to achieve this. 

## U-Net for Segmentation

Post detection, the next step is to segment the identified bottles. This is where the `U_Net_for_segmentation` directory comes into play. Inside this directory, one can find the scripts required to prepare the data, train and fine-tune the U-Net model specifically for bottle segmentation.

## Transitioning from Detection to Segmentation

The `detection_to_segmentation.ipynb` notebook serves as a bridge between the detection and segmentation phases. Once the bottles are detected using the Faster R-CNN model, this notebook processes the results, prepares the data, and transitions it to the segmentation phase. It demonstrates how the outputs from the detection model can be used as inputs for the segmentation model.
